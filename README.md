Purpose
=======

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate some technologies and solutions in the IaaS field.
Such solutions and technologies are:
 * No host agent
 * Event driven, no poll
 * NoSQL document store for VM data
 * User expectations
 * Scheduling as an optimization/constraint enforcement problem
 * No host-cluster
 * KSM
 * Simplicity in deployment and development
 * Minimal hardware requirements

Despite all of the above objectives:
 * it is not for architecture astronauts
 * must be simple and readable
